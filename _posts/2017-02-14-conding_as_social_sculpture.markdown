Last week we read an essay from Paul Graham "Hackers and Painters" which really caught my attention and gave me a perspective I did not have before on the relationship and similarities in the process of coding and painting. Coming from an art education background, I can definitely relate to it and appreciate it.
Reading this essay also got me into thinking of the very influencial German artist from the 70s, Joseph Beuys. 
Beuys had a very interesting ideology for a utopian society. One thing that he felt really passionate about was the idea that everyone is an artist. No matter the field or specialization, everyone has the potential to develop their creativity and it is by using it as a tool for problem solving through daily life that we become artists. He thought of this process as "social sculpture".
Coding is basically problem solving non-stop and I don't know how it would be possible without a creative mind. Prior to Flatiron School I had been learning the basics of coding on my own and I definitely noticed the need to have an open, resourceful and creative approach towards programming, but it wasn't until my first week here that I experienced the 'social' aspect of it and noticed the difference it makes; working together towards a common goal, breaking programs, coming up with solutions, breaking programs again, contributing with one another to see and understand the different approaches we have towards problem solving. It is through the interaction and active communication that we are constantly pushing one another into developing our creativity more and more. And that, I think, is a perfect example of social sculpture.
